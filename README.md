This repository contains all the necessary files for my website portfolio, my very first website!

I’m excited to dive into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a portfolio that is not only visually appealing but also efficient, engaging, and informative. I’ll be using Git locally and pushing updates to GitHub, a workflow I’m revisiting and plan to integrate into my workflow from now on.

The palette 🎨 I have chosen is the following:

<!--
#f76c6c
#a8d0e6
#f8e9a1
#24305e  
-->
