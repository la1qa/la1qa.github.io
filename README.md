This repository includes all necessary files for the creation of my website portfolio, also my first website ever. 
I hope to get my hands dirty and delve onto the world of html, css and javascript in order to achieve the ultimate pretty, efficient, interesting, and informative portfolio. I will also be using git locally and pushing onto github, which is something I haven't done in a while. I hope to include this in my workflow from now on.

The palette I have chosen is the following:

#f76c6c
#a8d0e6
#f8e9a1
#24305e
