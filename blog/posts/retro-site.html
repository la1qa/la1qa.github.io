    <h2>Building a Retro Personal Site in 2025</h2>
    <p><em>Posted on February 5, 2025</em></p>
    <p>This post walks through rebuilding a nostalgic 2000s-style blog with modern CSS variables, flex layouts, and a sprinkle of JavaScript for counters and auto-generated archives. The goal was to keep the charm of old blogs while using today’s standards.</p>
    <p>Highlights:
        <ul>
            <li>CSS variables for theming and quick tweaks</li>
            <li>Flexbox for the two-column layout that keeps the sidebar in place</li>
            <li>A small JS router to swap main content without touching the sidebar</li>
            <li>Automatic monthly archives driven by <code>data-date</code> attributes</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
